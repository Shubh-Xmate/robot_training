# robot_training
We are training a robot for a game developed on unity where basically we have to
predict its next move on the basis of the last n situations which are already given to
us. For this, we have built a model on Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural
networks.

#Major problem Handlng
Situation where the prediction of a class is less that 5%.
1) Changing the size of class.
2) Random Under-Sampling.
3) Random Over-Sampling.
4) Biasing the weights.
